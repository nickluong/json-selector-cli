# json-selector-cli

Welcome to my CLI, this program uses Inquirer.js for the prompt. (For installation use 'npm install inquirer')

This program isn't completely robust due to time restrictions and some confusion with the directions. However the program accepts input supporting search for class, className, and identifier. After an input is given, the program searches through the JSON and returns an array of view objects that matches the input.
